## 🌟 Core Features

- **Core Modules**: Data Collection, Data Management, Operator Marketplace, Data Cleaning, Data Synthesis, Data
  Annotation, Data Evaluation, Knowledge Generation.
- **Visual Orchestration**: Drag-and-drop data processing workflow design.
- **Operator Ecosystem**: Rich built-in operators and support for custom operators.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Git (for pulling source code)
- Make (for building and installing)
- Docker (for building images and deploying services)
- Docker-Compose (for service deployment - Docker method)
- Kubernetes (for service deployment - k8s method)
- Helm (for service deployment - k8s method)

### Clone the Code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ModelEngine-Group/DataMate.git
cd DataMate
```

### Deploy the basic services

```bash
make install
```

This project supports deployment via two methods: docker-compose and helm. After executing the command, please enter the corresponding number for the deployment method. The command echo is as follows:
```shell
Choose a deployment method:
1. Docker/Docker-Compose
2. Kubernetes/Helm
Enter choice:
```

If the machine you are using does not have make installed, please run the following command to deploy it:
```bash
REGISTRY=ghcr.io/modelengine-group/ docker compose -f deployment/docker/datamate/docker-compose.yml --profile milvus up -d
```

Once the container is running, access http://localhost:30000 in a browser to view the front-end interface.

To list all available Make targets, flags and help text, run:

```bash
make help
```

If you are in an offline environment, you can run the following command to download all dependent images:
```bash
make download
```

### Deploy Label Studio as an annotation tool
```bash
make install-label-studio
```

### Build and deploy Mineru Enhanced PDF Processing
```bash
make build-mineru
make install-mineru
```

### Deploy the DeerFlow service
```bash
make install-deer-flow
```

### Local Development and Deployment
After modifying the local code, please execute the following commands to build the image and deploy using the local image.
```bash
make build
make install dev=true
```

### Uninstall
```bash
make uninstall
```

When running make uninstall, the installer will prompt once whether to delete volumes; that single choice is applied to all components. The uninstall order is: milvus -> label-studio -> datamate, which ensures the datamate network is removed cleanly after services that use it have stopped.
